2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell loadingBelt_map/nextstate_reg[0]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) loadingBelt_map/nextstate_reg[0]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell loadingBelt_map/nextstate_reg[0]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) loadingBelt_map/nextstate_reg[0]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell loadingBelt_map/nextstate_reg[1]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) loadingBelt_map/nextstate_reg[1]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert
