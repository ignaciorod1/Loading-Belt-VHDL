# Loading-Belt-VHDL
This is a VHDL university project meant to be implemented in a Nexys 4 DDR Board.
The goal is to control a real loading belt that will feed pieces either to a robotic arm or a box at the end of the belt.
The robotic arm is controled by an STM32F411 Discovery Board (STM32 repository) which communicates with the FPGA.
